# COMP20270 - Numpy Module (reduced features)

## Introduction
The Python numpy module is used to work with arrays in Python and has a number of advanced features. This is a reduced version created as part of the module COMP20270 - Python Object-Oriented Programming. The MyArray class is used to create the numpy array. The user has the ability to obtain the maximum, minimum and mean value of the array or specific rows/columns in the array (toggled via the axis parameter). A copy of the array and an array with every element = 0 can be created with this class.
